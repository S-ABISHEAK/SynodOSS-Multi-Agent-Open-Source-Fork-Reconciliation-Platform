##  Overview

SynodOSS is an autonomous multi-agent system designed to solve one of the most expensive problems in enterprise software engineering:

**Open Source Fork Reconciliation.**

Organizations frequently fork open-source projects to introduce:
- Security fixes
- Proprietary integrations
- Compliance modifications
- Performance optimizations

Over time these forks diverge significantly from upstream repositories, making manual reconciliation expensive and error-prone.

SynodOSS introduces an AI-powered Engineering Council capable of:

- Detecting architectural drift
- Analyzing conflicting code evolution
- Debating reconciliation strategies
- Verifying proposed resolutions
- Generating Git-ready patches
- Producing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Creating Pull Request artifacts


##  Problem Statement

Traditional tools such as:

- Git Merge
- Git Rebase
- Dependabot
- Code Refactoring Assistants

operate at the file or function level.

They lack understanding of:

- Architectural intent
- Business constraints
- Enterprise customizations
- Long-term maintainability

As a result, organizations often spend weeks or months reconciling heavily diverged forks.

SynodOSS addresses this problem through structured multi-agent reasoning and verification-driven reconciliation.

---

#  Verification Pipeline

SynodOSS never trusts LLM output directly.

Every proposal passes through:

### 1. Evidence Validation

Checks:

- Commit references
- Diff references
- Reconciliation Units
- Agent claims

---

### 2. Structural Validation

Checks:

```python
ast.parse(...)
```

Validates:

- Syntax correctness
- Structural correctness

---

### 3. Ruff Validation

Checks:

- Undefined variables
- Import issues
- Style violations
- Structural errors

---

### 4. Patch Applicability

```bash
git apply --check patch.diff
```

Ensures:

- Diff is valid
- Patch can be applied
- No malformed hunks

---

#  Consensus Formula

Consensus confidence is calculated mathematically.

```text
Confidence

=
0.30 × Evidence Strength
+
0.25 × Evidence Coverage
+
0.20 × Argument Consistency
+
0.25 × Verification Score
```

All values are dynamically computed.

No hardcoded confidence values exist anywhere in the system.

---

#  Trust Score

Trust is generated independently from confidence.

```text
Trust

=
0.35 × Verification Success
+
0.25 × Evidence Coverage
+
0.20 × Consensus Strength
+
0.20 × Structural Integrity
```

Purpose:

- Prevent hallucinated decisions
- Penalize unsupported reasoning
- Reward verifiable outcomes

---

#  Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

Every reconciliation generates:

```text
Problem

Context

Agent Positions

Tradeoffs

Decision

Evidence

Verification Results

Future Risks
```

This creates a complete audit trail for every architectural decision.

---

#  Generated Patch Example

```diff
--- upstream/api.py

+++ reconciled/api.py

-def login(username, password):
+def login(username, password, token=None):

+    print("Logging in...")

     return True
```

Generated patches:

- Are deterministic
- Are Git-compatible
- Pass verification
- Never auto-merge

---

#  Pull Request Generation

Every successful reconciliation generates:

### Pull Request Title

```text
Reconcile Authentication API Divergence
```

### Pull Request Summary

```text
Preserved enterprise logging functionality
while adopting upstream authentication
interface improvements.
```

### Included Artifacts

- Debate Transcript
- ADR
- Verification Report
- Patch File
- Trust Score
